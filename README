## Description

Pukis is the classic convert-an-RC-car-to-a-robot project. It will be done in stages.




## Stages

TBW


## Building blocks

A cheap Porsche 911 GT2 RC car
A bunch of Arduinos of various descriptions
+ more


## Subsystems

### Lights

Handled by an Attiny85, which is fed state changes from the master controller in the car over I2C


### Remote control

So far, hacking into the existing TX2/RX2 IC combo in the car. Possibly using 2.4GHz modules for two-way communication
later.

The plan is to use a PC to control the car via a joystick, so on the control side we find an Arduino connected to a PC
and the code to get joystick commands out in the ether.


##Why 'Pukis'?

First of all, it's 'Pūķis', but Github doesn't like exotic characters and would name the repository 'P--is', so here we are.

Pūķis is a creature from Latvian folklore. It can be translated as 'dragon' or 'imp', but the meaning I'm going for is
'devil that steals things for its master'.
